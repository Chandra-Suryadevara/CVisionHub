To achieve the desired functionality, you can follow these steps:

1. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
    - Open your terminal or command prompt.
    - Navigate to the directory where you want to create the virtual environment.
    - Run the following command:
        ```
        python -m venv myenv
        ```
      This will create a virtual environment named `myenv`.

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
    - Depending on your operating system, activate the virtual environment:
        - **Windows:**
            ```
            myenv\Scripts\activate
            ```
        - **Linux/macOS:**
            ```
            source myenv/bin/activate
            ```

3. **Install Required Packages:**
    - Once the virtual environment is activated, you can install the required packages using `pip`.
        ```
        pip install numpy matplotlib opencv-python
        ```
